# ML_GenderClassification

- Data Set - IMDB wiki
- Data preprocessing is needed, here implemented preprocessing is not enough
- First data devided into 2 parts male and female based on the name given. rename_files.py file does this thing.
- naming of the directories explained in the programe.
- imageproc.py is for training and testing the data. 
- It takes about 75 minutes to train 6000 images and test on 1000 images and provide accuracy on intel core i3-5010U @2.10 GHz with 8 GB of Ram on it.
- It is adviced to use GPU and better CPU for training the model.
- Live testing of the model code is commented below in the same file.
